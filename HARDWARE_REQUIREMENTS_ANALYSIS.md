## Scaling Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling Strategy
```
1. Database Sharding:
   - Shard by user ID or room ID
   - Use Citus or native PostgreSQL partitioning
   
2. Bridge Distribution:
   - Distribute accounts across multiple bridge instances
   - Use consistent hashing for account assignment
   
3. Media CDN:
   - Use CDN for media distribution
   - Implement media retention policies
   
4. Message Queue:
   - Implement Redis/RabbitMQ for async processing
   - Separate queues for different message types
```

### Monitoring Requirements
```
Infrastructure:
- Prometheus + Grafana for metrics
- ELK stack for log aggregation
- Jaeger for distributed tracing
- PagerDuty for alerting

Key Metrics:
- Message latency < 500ms p99
- Database query time < 100ms p95
- Memory usage < 80%
- CPU usage < 70% sustained
- Disk I/O < 80% capacity
- Network utilization < 60%
```

### High Availability Setup
```
1. Database: PostgreSQL with streaming replication
   - 1 Primary + 2 Standby
   - Automatic failover with Patroni
   
2. Dendrite: Multiple instances behind HAProxy
   - Session affinity for clients
   - Health checks every 5s
   
3. Bridges: Active-Active configuration
   - Account distribution across instances
   - Automatic rebalancing on failure
   
4. Storage: Distributed filesystem (Ceph/GlusterFS)
   - 3x replication for critical data
   - 2x replication for media
```

## Performance Optimization Tips

### Database Optimization
```sql
-- Critical indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_events_room_id_stream ON events(room_id, stream_ordering);
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_events_sender_stream ON events(sender, stream_ordering);
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_state_groups_state ON state_groups_state(state_group);

-- Partitioning for large tables
CREATE TABLE events_2024 PARTITION OF events 
FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-01-01') TO ('2025-01-01');

-- Regular maintenance
VACUUM ANALYZE events;
REINDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_events_room_id_stream;
```

### Dendrite Configuration
```yaml
# Performance tuning
global:
  database:
    max_open_conns: 100
    max_idle_conns: 20
    conn_max_lifetime: 300
    
  cache:
    max_size_estimated: "10gb"
    max_age: "1h"
    
  jetstream:
    in_memory: true  # If enough RAM
    max_memory: 16gb
    
media_api:
  max_thumbnail_generators: 20
  base_path: /media  # Use fast SSD
  
federation_api:
  federation_max_retries: 3
  send_max_retries: 5
  key_validity_period: "24h"
```

### Linux Kernel Tuning
```bash
# /etc/sysctl.conf
net.core.somaxconn = 65535
net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog = 65535
net.core.netdev_max_backlog = 65535
net.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse = 1
net.ipv4.tcp_fin_timeout = 10
net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range = 10000 65000
fs.file-max = 2097152
fs.nr_open = 2097152

# Increase file descriptors
ulimit -n 1000000
```

- Complete migration to 12,000 users
- Continuous optimization
- Capacity planning for growth

## Conclusion

For a deployment of this scale (12,000 concurrent connections), a distributed architecture is strongly recommended. The single-server approach would require extremely high-end hardware and presents a single point of failure. 

**Key Recommendations:**
1. Start with the distributed cluster approach
2. Use PostgreSQL with proper indexing and partitioning
3. Implement comprehensive monitoring from day one
4. Plan for 50% headroom on all resources
5. Consider geo-distribution for global users
6. Implement proper backup and disaster recovery

**Total Investment Required:**
- Hardware: $150,000 - $200,000
- Annual Operating Costs: $50,000 - $100,000
- Or Cloud: $300,000 - $420,000/year

This configuration should provide excellent performance with room for growth to 20,000+ total accounts.
